- This allows you to get the data from different cloud resources. like an fetching API and use it 
- Ex: Maybe some resources created which is not part of our terraform, but want to pass its value to one of our terarform resources. ex: VPC created manually and want to pass its id to terraform subnet. - use data source and use it
